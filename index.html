        <h1>Welcome to Val's cooking page!</h1> <!--Page Header-->
        <h2>Cooking isn't just about the food, it is an experience to be had!</h2> <!--Still a header, this one isn't as important as the page name-->
            <p>Cooking is more than making a meal, it is an art. To understand this type of art you have to break it down from before step 1. At the beginning of every program we will host a couple classes going over the basics you need to know. In addition, we will also host a couple classes that dive deeper into the ingredients and what purposes they serve. These classes will vary from program to program, but you'll walk out with the same general knowledge. Whether you're cooking for fun, for pay or to learn, you have come to the right place!</p>
