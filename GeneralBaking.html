    <h1>What is baking?</h1>
    <p id="baking">Baking is more than just sweets and decorating. Baking is considered to be the most attractive part of the kitchen. This may be true in some ways, but I have seen many dinners that look beautiful. But, at the end of the day, baking is an art and you are your only limit. The art of breadmaking is considered to be under the umbrella of baking.</p>
    <!--This is an overview of the main types of desserts that will be taught at the imaginary cooking school-->
    <h3 class="type" id="cookies">Cookies:</h3> 
        <p> These are an easy introduction into baking. All of our introductory baking classes work on learning the art of cookies. From Chocolate Chip and the various versions that exsist out there to harder ones like Macaroons and Meringue. If you're up to the challenge!</p>

    <h3 class="type" id="cakes">Cakes & Cupcakes:</h3>
    <p>Getting the perfect round, flat, cake takes practice and skill. And even then, one little thing can change the entire appearance of your goodie. We will learn how to measure the perfect amount of batter for every layer of cake and cupcake.</p><!--Enter Photo Here!-->

    <p id="note">*Once you are comfortable with cakes and cupcakes, we will work on bread making. Bread making is harder to master, but the end product is always worth it! We will start off every class with paying attention to a sourdough starter. If you are a return cooker, we will check on our sourdough starter and feed it, as needed. If you are new, we can teach you how to start a sourdough starter for your own sourdough adventures!
     We are always open to what breads you want to learn how to make!</p>
    <p id="note">*Please keep in mind, this is the order that we reccomend, please feel free to take classes in any order you want, or skip those you aren't interested in!</p>

    Note: We can work with recipes that meet most dietary restrictions, however please keep in mind that there is gluten present throughout our kitchens. We try to be as inclusive as we can, and we strive to have a gluten free kitchen where we can host gluten free cooking classes!
